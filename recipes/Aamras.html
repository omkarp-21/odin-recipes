    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Aamras (also known as amras) is a sweet dish in the cuisine of the Indian subcontinent made from the pulp of the mango fruit. The pulp of a ripe mango is extracted, usually by hand, and is eaten together with pooris or chapatis, Indian breads. Sometimes ghee and milk are added to the pulp to enhance its flavour. Sugar may be added for sweetness. It is often eaten at celebrations and weddings with cardamon and chopped fruits. A regional version of aamras is a popular dessert in Marathi and Rajasthani cuisines as well as Marwari and Gujarati homes, especially during festivities.

        Originally a traditional dish from Maharashtra, it is very popular in other parts of India. Since the fruit is seasonal, being harvested at the end of summer, the need to preserve the fruit in the form of pulp has given rise to a moderately large mango-processing industry.

        The word "aamras" is derived from the Sanskrit words āmra (Sanskrit: आम्र; lit. 'mango') and rasa (Sanskrit: रस; lit. 'juice'), so the literal meaning is "mango juice".
