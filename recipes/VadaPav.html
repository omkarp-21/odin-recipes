    Although it originated as an affordable street food in Mumbai, it is now served in food stalls and restaurants across India. It is also called Bombay burger in keeping with its origins and its resemblance in physical form to a burger. The most famous snack in Mumbai, vada pav is claimed to be a part of the culture of Mumbaikars.</p>
